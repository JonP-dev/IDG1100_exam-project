###--Apache page hosting steps--###

- Ensure Apache 2 is installed, and ensure Apache 2 is running.

- Add the page to sites-available.

- Add aliases and enable eventual scripts for running.

- Restart/reload Apache 2, ensure it runs without errors.

- Go to you custom URL as a substitute for localhost.

- OPTIONAL: Do the same steps as above, but ensure specific webpages
            also have their unique URLs (configure relevant Apache files).

- OPTIONAL: Create a "deploy.sh"-file that copies files from the code-repository
            location over to "var/www/..." with required permissions for
            automation of the "code to page-hosting"-process.

- Test the webpage and screenshot it for the PDF-report.
